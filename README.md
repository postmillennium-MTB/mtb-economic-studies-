## 1. Purpose and Intended Audience

This tool exists to answer a question that comes up at nearly every city council meeting, parks commission hearing, and community planning session where trails are on the agenda:

> *"We know trails are nice. But do they pay back?"*

The answer, supported by more than 50 peer-reviewed and practitioner studies, is that they do — often substantially. But the magnitude varies enormously by community size, trail quality, visitor mix, and local economic conditions. A one-size-fits-all talking point does not serve advocates or decision-makers well.

This calculator is designed to let users plug in their own local numbers — construction cost estimates, home values, property tax rates, estimated visitor counts — and see a projection grounded in real data rather than a generic national average.

**Primary audiences:**

- **Community advocates** building the economic case for a trail project proposal
- **City council members and commissioners** evaluating whether public investment in trails is financially defensible
- **Parks and recreation directors** preparing budget justifications
- **Economic development staff** modeling outdoor recreation as an industry
- **Journalists and researchers** exploring the outdoor recreation economy at a local level

**What this tool is not:** It is not a certified economic impact study, an appraisal, or a financial forecast. It is a planning and advocacy aid. Results should be validated with local tax records, visitor surveys, and comparable trail data before being presented in a formal municipal context.

## 2. How to Use the Tool

The tool is a single self-contained HTML file. Open it in any modern web browser — no server, no installation, no internet connection required after the initial load (Google Fonts will load if online, but the calculator functions offline).

**Step 1 — Choose a scenario.** The three buttons at the top right (Conservative / Moderate / Optimistic) pre-load a set of assumptions calibrated to different levels of trail development, visitor volume, and economic context. This is the fastest way to get a meaningful baseline.

**Step 2 — Adjust inputs for your community.** Every slider represents a variable you should try to localize. The most important ones to get right are:
- Miles of trail (your actual project scope)
- Construction cost per mile (get a local contractor estimate)
- Annual visitors per mile (survey existing comparable trails if possible)
- Homes within ½ mile (pull from your county GIS or assessor data)
- Average home value (use county assessor median for nearby parcels)
- Property tax rate (your municipality's current millage rate)
- City sales tax rate (your city's share of the combined sales tax rate)

**Step 3 — Adjust modeling assumptions.** The visitor ramp-up, annual growth rate, percentage of out-of-town visitors, and maintenance inflation rate all materially affect multi-year projections. Read the sections below to understand what each one means before adjusting.

**Step 4 — Read the results.** The four metric cards at the top of the results panel provide the headline numbers. The breakeven chart shows the full trajectory. The year-by-year table lets you examine every year's individual values.

## 4. The Three Pre-Set Scenarios

Each scenario represents a realistic but distinct context. They are calibrated to actual case study data from the research literature, not invented symmetrically around a midpoint.

### Conservative

Intended to represent a smaller rural or suburban community building a modest trail system that primarily serves local residents, with limited destination appeal in the early years. Visitor spending benchmarks are drawn from the Duluth, MN study (the lowest-spending destination in the TPL/IMBA meta-analysis).

| Parameter | Value | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Miles | 15 | Modest first phase |
| Construction cost/mi | $35,000 | Partially volunteer-built or low-complexity terrain |
| Maintenance/mi/yr | $1,500 | Minimal corridor; volunteer-supplemented |
| Visitors/mile/yr | 500 | Small community, limited marketing |
| Avg spend/visit | $103 | Duluth, MN benchmark (TPL 2025) |
| Overnight visitors | 15% | Primarily day-use |
| Out-of-town visitors | 40% | Mostly local/regional |
| Sales tax rate | 1.5% | Lower municipal share |
| Property value premium | 3% | Lower end of NAR/Crompton research range |
| Visitor growth/yr | 1% | Slow build |
| Ramp-up period | 3 years | Conservative adoption |
| Maintenance inflation | 3% | Full CPI escalation |

### Moderate

Represents a mid-sized community investing in a professionally designed trail system with genuine destination appeal. Visitor spending benchmarks reflect a regional average across the TPL/IMBA case studies.

| Parameter | Value | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Miles | 10 | Focused quality network |
| Construction cost/mi | $50,000 | Professional design; mixed terrain |
| Maintenance/mi/yr | $2,500 | Mid-range professional maintenance |
| Visitors/mile/yr | 1,000 | Mid-range destination |
| Avg spend/visit | $175 | Regional mid-range average |
| Overnight visitors | 30% | Mixed day-trip and overnight |
| Out-of-town visitors | 60% | Genuine destination appeal |
| Sales tax rate | 2.0% | Typical municipal share |
| Property value premium | 5% | Midpoint of NAR/Crompton research range |
| Visitor growth/yr | 3% | Moderate growth; below global MTB CAGR |
| Ramp-up period | 2 years | Standard adoption curve |
| Maintenance inflation | 2% | Moderate CPI |

### Optimistic

Represents a purpose-built destination trail system with strong marketing, significant out-of-town draw, and visitor spending at the upper end of the research range. Modeled after destinations like Kingdom Trails (VT), Chattanooga (TN), or the Chequamegon area (WI).

| Parameter | Value | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Miles | 20 | Destination-scale network |
| Construction cost/mi | $60,000 | Professional build with features |
| Maintenance/mi/yr | $3,000 | Higher-quality maintenance standard |
| Visitors/mile/yr | 2,000 | Strong destination draw |
| Avg spend/visit | $416 | TPL/IMBA 2025 national average across 50 studies |
| Overnight visitors | 50% | Majority stay overnight |
| Out-of-town visitors | 75% | Primarily destination visitors |
| Sales tax rate | 2.5% | Higher municipal capture |
| Property value premium | 8% | Upper-mid range; consistent with active trail destination |
| Visitor growth/yr | 6% | Strong growth; below global MTB CAGR of 8.9% |
| Ramp-up period | 1 year | Fast adoption with marketing |
| Maintenance inflation | 0% | Off; real-dollar comparison |

## 5. The Economic Model — Complete Formulas

The model computes all values year-by-year from Year 1 through the projection horizon (and up to Year 65 to find the breakeven point if it falls outside the displayed range). Nothing is computed as a flat annuity. Every year's values depend on ramp-up, growth, and inflation compounding from the prior year.

### 5.1 Input Variables

```
miles           = total trail miles
buildcost       = construction cost per mile ($)
maint           = base maintenance cost per mile per year ($)
visitors        = target annual visitors per mile at full capacity
spend           = average spending per visit ($)
overnight       = fraction of visitors who stay overnight (0–1)
nonlocal        = fraction of visitors who are out-of-town (0–1)
salestax        = city's sales tax rate (0–1)
homes           = number of homes within ½ mile of trail
homeval         = average home value ($)
propprem        = property value premium from trail proximity (0–1)
proptax         = property tax rate (0–1)
multiplier      = economic multiplier applied to out-of-town spending
visitorgrowth   = annual visitor growth rate (0–1)
rampup          = number of years to reach full visitor capacity (integer)
inflation       = annual maintenance cost escalation rate (0–1)
years           = projection horizon (integer)
```

### 5.2 Derived Constants (computed once)

```
capitalCost     = miles × buildcost
maintBase       = miles × maint
baseVisitors    = miles × visitors
propTaxAnn      = homes × homeval × propprem × proptax
propValueAdded  = homes × homeval × propprem
```

**`propTaxAnn`** is treated as constant across all years. The property value premium is assumed to be realized in Year 1 and held flat in real terms. This is a conservative treatment; in practice, trail-adjacent property values may continue to appreciate.

### 5.3 Effective Spending Per Visit

Overnight visitors spend approximately twice as much as day visitors because they pay for lodging and additional meals. Rather than modeling two separate visitor populations, the tool blends them into a single effective spend figure:

```
effectiveSpend = spend × (1 + overnight)
```

**Derivation:** Let `d` = day-trip spend = `spend`, and overnight spend = `2 × spend`. The blend of a population that is `overnight` fraction overnight and `(1 - overnight)` fraction day-trippers gives:

```
effectiveSpend = spend × (1 - overnight) + (2 × spend) × overnight
              = spend × (1 - overnight + 2 × overnight)
              = spend × (1 + overnight)
```

*Example:* With `spend = $175` and `overnight = 0.30`, `effectiveSpend = $175 × 1.30 = $227.50`.

### 5.4 Year-by-Year Visitor Count

For each year `yr` from 1 to `maxYears`:

**Ramp-up factor:**

```
if rampup = 0 OR yr > rampup:
    rampFactor = 1.0

else if rampup = 1:
    rampFactor = 0.40   (single-year ramp: 40% capacity in Year 1)

else:
    rampFactor = 0.40 + 0.60 × (yr - 1) / (rampup - 1)
```

This produces a linear interpolation from 40% capacity in the first ramp-up year to 100% in the final ramp-up year. The 40% starting point is calibrated from observed ramp-up curves at Duluth (MN), Blue Derby (Tasmania), and Kingdom Trails (VT).

**Growth factor** (compounds from end of ramp-up):

```
growthYrs = max(0,  yr - rampup)       if rampup > 0
growthYrs = yr - 1                      if rampup = 0

growthFactor = (1 + visitorgrowth) ^ growthYrs
```

**Visitors in year `yr`:**

```
visitorsYr = baseVisitors × rampFactor × growthFactor
```

*Example (Moderate scenario, Year 5 with 2-year ramp-up and 3% annual growth):*
- `rampFactor = 1.0` (ramp-up ended after Year 2)
- `growthYrs = 5 - 2 = 3`
- `growthFactor = 1.03^3 = 1.0927`
- `visitorsYr = (10 mi × 1,000/mi) × 1.0 × 1.0927 = 10,927 visitors`

### 5.5 Annual Spending

```
totalSpendYr  = visitorsYr × effectiveSpend
nonLocalSpend = totalSpendYr × nonlocal
localSpend    = totalSpendYr × (1 - nonlocal)
```

### 5.6 Annual Municipal Revenue

Sales tax is collected regardless of whether the visitor is local or out-of-town, because both groups transact within the municipality:

```
salesTaxYr = totalSpendYr × salestax
muniYr     = salesTaxYr + propTaxAnn
```

Note that `propTaxAnn` does not vary by year in this model. It is the incremental property tax revenue generated by the trail-proximity premium on nearby homes.

### 5.7 Annual Economic Impact

The economic impact to the local economy treats local and out-of-town visitors differently. Out-of-town visitors bring money that would not otherwise enter the local economy, so their spending is amplified by the economic multiplier. Local visitors are largely spending money they already have; their dollars recirculate rather than grow the economy, so the multiplier is 1.0.

```
econYr = (nonLocalSpend × multiplier) + (localSpend × 1.0)
       = nonLocalSpend × multiplier + localSpend
```

*Example (Moderate, Year 5 as above with nonlocal = 0.60, multiplier = 1.5):*
```
totalSpendYr  = 10,927 × $227.50 = $2,485,893
nonLocalSpend = $2,485,893 × 0.60 = $1,491,536
localSpend    = $2,485,893 × 0.40 = $994,357

econYr = ($1,491,536 × 1.5) + $994,357
       = $2,237,304 + $994,357
       = $3,231,661
```

This treatment is consistent with the methodology in the Duluth, MN study (Savolt, 2017), which explicitly separated local and non-local impacts, and with the methodological critique in Buning & Lamont (2021), which found that failure to separate local and out-of-town spending is the most common source of inflated economic impact figures in practitioner studies.

### 5.8 Annual Maintenance Cost with Inflation

Trail maintenance is heavily labor-driven. Labor costs compound with general CPI inflation, which historically runs 2–4% in the United States. The nominal maintenance cost in year `yr` is:

```
maintYr = maintBase × (1 + inflation) ^ (yr - 1)
```

Year 1 maintenance = `maintBase` (the base-year value entered by the user). Year 20 maintenance at 3% inflation = `maintBase × 1.03^19 = maintBase × 1.754`. In other words, nominal maintenance costs grow by approximately 75% over 20 years at 3% inflation.

When inflation is set to "Off" (0%), all years use `maintBase` unchanged. This is appropriate for analyses conducted in constant (real) dollars, but it understates nominal future costs.

### 5.9 Cumulative Values

Each year `yr` accumulates from all prior years:

```
cumCost[yr] = capitalCost + Σ(maintYr) for yr' = 1 to yr
cumMuni[yr] = Σ(muniYr)  for yr' = 1 to yr
cumEcon[yr] = Σ(econYr)  for yr' = 1 to yr
```

### 5.10 Breakeven Year

The breakeven year is defined as the first year in which cumulative municipal revenue equals or exceeds the initial construction cost, ignoring maintenance costs:

```
breakeven = min(yr) such that cumMuni[yr] ≥ capitalCost
```

**Why is maintenance excluded from breakeven?** Because the breakeven question being answered is: *"Does the community's tax revenue from this trail eventually pay back the upfront capital investment?"* Maintenance is an ongoing operational expense, like maintaining a park or a road, and is typically budgeted separately from capital recovery. Including maintenance in the breakeven denominator would never produce a breakeven for most public infrastructure, including roads, parks, and utilities.

The cost line in the breakeven chart does include cumulative maintenance, so the visual shows total cost including maintenance — it is only the single breakeven threshold that compares municipal revenue against construction cost alone.

The model searches up to Year 65. If no breakeven is found within 65 years, the result is displayed as "> 65 years."

### 5.11 10-Year Return on Construction Cost

```
roi10 = (cumMuni[10] / capitalCost - 1) × 100%
```

This is expressed as a percentage return on the construction investment over 10 years, using only direct municipal revenue (tax receipts). A value of +50% means cumulative municipal tax revenue over 10 years equals 150% of the construction cost.

### 5.12 Jobs Estimate

The labor income benchmark of approximately $45,000 per FTE is drawn from IMBA regional studies (cited in the TPL/IMBA 2025 meta-analysis, which found trail networks across 13 locations generated up to $54.1 million in labor income supporting up to 1,626 jobs — a ratio of approximately $33,000–$45,000 per job). The tool uses the upper end of this range as a more current figure.

```
jobs = round(econYr[matureYear] / 45,000)
```

where `matureYear = rampup + 1` (first year at full capacity, before growth).

### 5.13 Mature Year (for Donut Chart)

The donut chart shows the annual benefit breakdown for the "mature year" — the first year the trail reaches full capacity, before growth compounds further. This provides a representative annual snapshot.

```
matureIndex = rampup       (0-indexed; corresponds to year rampup + 1)
```

If `rampup = 0`, mature year = Year 1. If `rampup = 2`, mature year = Year 3.

## 6. Assumptions, Justifications, and Sources

### 6.1 Visitor Spending Benchmarks

**Conservative: $103/trip**
Drawn from the University of Minnesota Duluth study (Savolt, 2017), the lowest per-visit spending recorded among all destinations in the TPL/IMBA 2025 meta-analysis. Appropriate for local trail systems with limited overnight accommodation and primarily day-use visitors.

**Moderate: $175/trip**
A regional middle estimate between the Duluth low ($103/day) and the Vermont Kingdom Trails figure ($176/day). Consistent with typical small-to-mid-size destination trails with some overnight accommodation.

**Optimistic: $416/trip**
The national average across all 50 studies in the TPL/IMBA 2025 meta-analysis (Horn et al., 2025). This reflects a broad mix of rural destination trails, bike parks, and events. The range across all studies was $103 to $1,107 per trip; the Chequamegon area (WI) recorded $1,107/trip as the highest in the dataset.

### 6.2 Overnight Visitor Spending Multiplier

The assumption that overnight visitors spend approximately twice as much as day visitors is consistent with general tourism research and specifically cited in the TPL/IMBA 2025 report, which notes that overnight visitors pay for lodging, additional meals, and extended retail purchases that day visitors do not. The $416/trip average in the meta-analysis blends day-trip and overnight visits; the 2× multiplier for overnight is applied by the model before that blend is taken into account, so users can adjust the overnight fraction independently.

### 6.3 Economic Multiplier

**Range: 1.2–1.8×**

The economic multiplier (also called the IMPLAN or input-output multiplier) captures the ripple effect of visitor spending. When a mountain biker spends $175 at a local restaurant, the restaurant owner uses some of that revenue to pay local staff, who spend some of their wages locally, and so on. Each round is smaller than the last. The total economic activity generated per dollar of initial visitor spending is the multiplier.

The 1.5× default reflects the regional average for rural/small-city tourism multipliers in IMPLAN-based studies. Smaller, more isolated communities tend to have lower multipliers (1.2–1.3×) because more money leaks out of the local economy to regional suppliers. Larger, more diversified economies may have multipliers of 1.7–2.0×.

Critically, this tool applies the multiplier only to out-of-town visitor spending. Local visitor spending is assigned a multiplier of 1.0 because local residents are largely substituting trail-related spending for other spending they would have made in the same local economy. Applying the full multiplier to local spending inflates the economic impact figure and has been identified as a common methodological error in practitioner studies (Buning & Lamont, 2021).

### 6.4 Property Value Premium

**Range: 0–15%, default 3–8% by scenario**

The research on trail proximity and property values is remarkably consistent: trails increase, or at worst do not decrease, nearby home values. The typical finding is a 3–5% premium for homes within approximately ½ mile of a trail.

Key findings from the literature:

- Crompton & Nicholls (2019): reviewed 20+ studies; concluded 3–5% premium is the most widespread finding for single-family homes near trails.
- Nicholls & Crompton (2005): found premiums of 5–10% in various locations.
- Indianapolis Cultural Trail: $1 billion increase in assessed property values within 500 feet of the trail between 2008 and 2014.
- Little Miami Scenic Trail (OH): each additional foot closer to the trail added approximately $7 to home value, suggesting a significant premium for directly adjacent properties.
- San Antonio, TX: 2% increase for homes near trails; 5% for homes adjacent to greenbelt-surrounded trails.
- Burke-Gilman Trail (Seattle): properties near but not immediately adjacent sell for ~6% more on average.

The ½-mile radius used in this tool is consistent with the typical study boundary in the peer-reviewed literature.

### 6.5 Visitor Ramp-up

**Default: 2 years (Moderate); starts at 40% capacity in Year 1**

New trail systems rarely achieve their long-run visitor counts immediately. Word-of-mouth, destination reputation, trail review platforms (Trailforks, MTB Project), and event programming all take time to develop. Evidence from case studies:

- Blue Derby, Tasmania: sustained multi-year visitor growth after opening, achieving peak recognition when it won international trail awards in 2017 and 2019.
- Kingdom Trails, Vermont: grew from a regional trail to an international destination over several years following systematic investment and marketing.
- Duluth, MN: visitation grew substantially as the trail network expanded and regional awareness increased.

The 40% starting capacity figure is a calibrated approximation consistent with these trajectories. Users who have evidence that their planned trail will be immediately well-used (e.g., a trail that connects to an existing popular network) should set ramp-up to 0 or 1 year. Users expecting a slow build in a new destination should use 3–5 years.

### 6.6 Annual Visitor Growth Rate

**Range: 0–10%; defaults: 1% conservative, 3% moderate, 6% optimistic**

The global mountain bike market is growing at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 5.8–8.9% (Technavio, 2025). Individual trail destinations typically grow more slowly than the overall market because they are constrained by geography, accommodation capacity, and marketing budget. Appropriate local growth rate estimates:

- Established regional trails with modest marketing: 1–2%
- Mid-tier destination with active promotion: 3–4%
- Purpose-built destination with strong branding: 5–7%
- Exceptional new destination (rare): 8–10%

Growth compounds from the first year after the ramp-up period ends. It is applied to the full-capacity baseline visitor count, not the ramp-up-reduced count.

### 6.7 Maintenance Inflation

**Default inflation rates: 3% conservative, 2% moderate, Off for optimistic**

Trail maintenance costs are dominated by labor: trail crew wages, equipment operator costs, and contractor fees for drainage work, erosion repair, and surface grading. These costs compound with general wage inflation and CPI.

At 3% annual inflation, the nominal maintenance cost in Year 20 is approximately 81% higher than in Year 1. A trail system that costs $2,500/mile/year to maintain today would nominally cost $4,516/mile/year in Year 20 at 3% CPI.

When analyzing in constant (real) dollars — as is common in academic economic impact studies — setting inflation to "Off" is correct, but only if you also interpret all projected revenues in constant dollars. When presenting to a city council considering a budget appropriation, nominal (inflating) costs are more relevant because budget line items are nominal.

The default for the Moderate scenario (2% inflation) represents a conservative real-terms escalation that acknowledges labor cost growth without assuming the highest plausible CPI scenario.

### 6.8 Local vs. Out-of-Town Visitor Split

**Default: 40% out-of-town (conservative), 60% (moderate), 75% (optimistic)**

This is arguably the single most important variable in the model. It directly determines how much of the visitor activity represents genuine new economic activity versus recirculation of existing local spending.

**Why it matters so much:** Suppose a trail attracts 10,000 annual visitors. If all 10,000 are local residents who now bike at the trail instead of going to the gym or shopping at a mall in the same town, the economic impact of visitor spending is zero (or even slightly negative, if the trail shifted spending from higher-tax-generating businesses). If all 10,000 are visitors from other cities who are spending money they would otherwise have spent somewhere else, the impact of their spending is substantial new economic activity.

Real-world destination trail systems typically report 50–80% out-of-town visitors among those surveyed. However, local trail systems with no destination profile may have 80–90% local users. Community advocates should survey local trail users if possible, or use comparable trail data from their region.

The model does not reduce local visitor economic impact to zero — local visitors still generate sales tax revenue and spend at local businesses. The difference is that their spending does not grow the economy through the multiplier effect, because it substitutes for other local spending.

## 7. What the Tool Does Not Model

The following economic benefits are documented in the research literature but are not included in this tool. They are excluded not because they are unreal, but because they are harder to quantify reliably at a community level, and including speculative figures in a tool intended for advocacy and municipal planning would undermine credibility.

### 7.1 Healthcare Cost Savings

The American Heart Association (2011) found that for every $1 invested in trails, approximately $3 is saved in direct healthcare costs through increased physical activity and improved cardiovascular health. In Northwest Arkansas, mountain biking trails were specifically associated with $8.7 million per year in avoided healthcare costs (TPL/IMBA, 2025). For municipalities with self-funded employee health insurance or significant Medicaid exposure, this is a real budget consideration but is difficult to localize without health outcome data.

### 7.2 New Resident Attraction and Workforce Effects

A survey in Tasmania's Break O'Day Council found that approximately 25% of people moving to the area were influenced by the MTB trail network (Break O'Day Council, 2025). The Carolina Thread Trail study (ITRE/NC State, 2022) documented trails as a draw for young professionals choosing where to live. West Virginia's Ascend WV program explicitly uses outdoor recreation access as a workforce attraction strategy. These effects are real and increasingly well-documented, but translating them into a per-mile dollar figure for a specific community requires local migration and demographic data that is not generally available.

### 7.3 Event Revenue

Major mountain bike events — races, festivals, competitions — generate economic impacts that dwarf regular trail use in a single weekend. The Crankworx Whistler Festival (2023) generated approximately $38.5 million USD from a single event with 300,000 attendees. Smaller local events can generate $200,000–$500,000 in a rural community over a weekend. This is excluded because it is highly variable and depends on event programming decisions that are separate from trail infrastructure.

### 7.4 New Business Formation

Historic examples include Milford, Delaware (where a greenway trail investment correlated with a net gain in new downtown businesses and 250+ new downtown jobs) and Oakridge, Oregon (a former logging town that revitalized its economy around mountain biking). These long-run economic restructuring effects are plausible but too slow-moving and speculative to model with precision.

### 7.5 Stormwater and Environmental Value

Trail and greenway corridors reduce impervious surface runoff, reducing municipal stormwater management costs. The Carolina Thread Trail study (ITRE, 2022) calculated dollar values for carbon storage, sequestration, and emissions reductions attributable to the trail greenway. These are real but small relative to the visitor economic impact figures and require ecological data.

### 7.6 Consumer Surplus and Recreational Value

Academic studies (Moran, Tresidder & McVittie, 2006; Bickel, 2020) use travel cost methods to estimate the total welfare value visitors receive, including the portion they would have paid if charged a fee. Glentress, Scotland estimated £80 per visit in consumer surplus against approximately 120,000 annual visits. This represents real welfare, but is not a municipal revenue figure and is less useful for budget-oriented advocacy.

### 7.7 Reduced Road Infrastructure Costs

Increased cycling as a transportation mode reduces vehicle miles traveled on municipal roads, extending road life and reducing road maintenance costs. The National Bicycle and Pedestrian Clearinghouse estimated that 50% of car trips are less than 3 miles — many of which could be made by bicycle on connected trail systems. This is more relevant to urban trail and greenway planning than to backcountry singletrack.

## 8. A Note on Methodology and Limitations

### On the academic literature

Buning & Lamont (2021), in a critical review of 33 academic and practitioner mountain bike economic impact studies, found "widespread inconsistency in instrumentation and variable measurement contributing to a fragmented body of knowledge." Specific problems they identified included:

- Failure to separate local versus non-local visitor spending (leads to inflated multiplier effects)
- Inconsistent definitions of the "study area" (some studies count regional impacts, some only local)
- Variation in survey methodology (on-trail intercept surveys vs. online surveys produce different demographics)
- Inclusion of "resident value" alongside "tourism value" without clear delineation
- Inadequate seasonal adjustment (most surveys are conducted in peak season)

This tool attempts to address the most important of these by: (1) explicitly separating local and non-local visitor spending with different multipliers; (2) providing the local vs. out-of-town slider so users can reflect their own community's visitor mix; and (3) clearly labeling "direct municipal revenue" (actual tax receipts) separately from "economic impact" (total economic activity, which is not a government revenue figure).

### On the property value research

Crompton & Nicholls (2019) note that most property value studies rely on hedonic price modeling — statistical models that isolate the contribution of trail proximity from other factors (school quality, neighborhood, age of home, etc.). These models require large datasets of comparable sales and sophisticated econometrics. The 3–15% range in the literature reflects genuine variation across contexts, not methodological uncertainty about a single "true" value. Communities with higher baseline property values, better trail access, and more active outdoor cultures tend to show larger premiums.

### What this tool should and should not be used for

**Appropriate uses:**
- Internal planning to understand the range of possible returns before committing to a project
- Community presentations to illustrate the economic logic of trail investment
- Identifying which input variables matter most (sensitivity analysis by moving individual sliders)
- Comparing scenarios for a city council presentation

**Inappropriate uses:**
- Presenting specific dollar figures as though they were economic forecasts or appraisals
- Replacing a formal economic impact study for a major public investment decision
- Litigation, bond prospectus preparation, or formal feasibility studies

If you are working on a major trail project (over $1 million in public investment), we recommend commissioning a formal economic impact study using IMPLAN, REMI, or a comparable regional input-output model calibrated to your specific community.

## 9. Highway Cost Comparison Context

The highway cost comparison is included to give decision-makers a sense of proportionality. Trail infrastructure is extremely inexpensive compared to road infrastructure, yet it is often treated as a discretionary luxury rather than essential public infrastructure.

| Infrastructure type | Cost per mile (USD) | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Volunteer-built singletrack | $2,000–$15,000 | American Trails database; MTBR forum surveys |
| Professional contractor-built singletrack | $25,000–$80,000 | Singletracks.com contractor survey, April 2026 |
| 2-lane rural road (new construction) | $3,000,000–$10,000,000 | FHWA / DOT compiled data, 2020–2024 |
| 4-lane suburban highway | $10,000,000–$40,000,000 | FHWA / DOT compiled data |
| Urban 6-lane interstate | $40,000,000–$150,000,000 | FHWA / DOT compiled data |

The bar chart uses a logarithmic scale because the actual dollar differences span five orders of magnitude (roughly 10,000× from volunteer trail to urban interstate). Linear scaling would render trail costs invisible on the chart. The logarithmic transformation preserves the relative visual proportions while making all bars legible.

## 10. Contributing and Forking

This tool is intentionally simple: a single HTML file with no build process, no dependencies to install, and no server required. Contributions are welcome.

**To suggest improvements:**
- Open an issue describing the change and its evidentiary basis
- If proposing a new economic factor, please cite at least two peer-reviewed or government-published sources

**Planned future enhancements (not yet implemented):**
- Healthcare cost savings module (with toggle)
- Event revenue module (with toggle)
- New resident attraction module
- Export to PDF / printable summary for council presentations
- Metric / imperial unit toggle
- Localization support for non-US contexts (GST, rates in local currency)

**If you fork this for a specific community:**
Consider replacing the default slider values with pre-populated local data (assessor median home value, current tax rates, comparable trail visitor counts from the nearest regional system). The closer the defaults are to local reality, the more credible the tool will be when presented to decision-makers.
